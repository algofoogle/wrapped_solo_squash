# Stuff to help verification of our design within caravel (i.e. caravel_user_project):
caravel_test:
  recipe: coco_test                 # Makefile recipe to exercise tests of our design in caravel.
  directory: solo_squash_caravel    # Name of the directory in this repo that will be copied to verilog/dv/
  id: 1                             # Our PROJECT_ID (to identify which LA0 bit is our 'active' line).
  module_name: wrapped_solo_squash  # Verilog module name that is our design to be instantiated in user_project_wrapper.

# How to run tests of the design itself, in isolation:
module_test:
  recipe: test                      # Makefile recipe that runs tests.
  directory: solo_squash            # The working directory from which tests should be run.
  makefile: Makefile                # Makefile (inside 'directory') to use.
